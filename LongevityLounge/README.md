### **Roadmap Document for Integrating Guest Checkout and Subscription Models**

#### **Project Overview:**

We aim to integrate guest checkout and subscription-based services into an existing appointment scheduling platform for a sauna bath business. This will include both one-time guest checkout options and subscription plans, with an expanded analytics dashboard to track relevant metrics.

    - Include visuals like “Current Plan,” “Next Billing Date,” etc.
- **Deliverable**: Updated Frontend Components for Guest Checkout and Subscriptions

### **4. Backend Development**

- **Objective**: Implement APIs for managing guest checkouts, subscriptions, and payment processing.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Guest Checkout API**:
    - Develop endpoints for processing guest checkouts.
    - Integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for guest transactions.
  - **Subscription Management API**:
    - Create endpoints to handle subscription creation, updates, and cancellations.
    - Implement billing cycles and renewals.

    - Update middleware to differentiate guest sessions from registered users.
- **Deliverable**: API Endpoints for Guest Checkout, Subscription Management, and Billing

### **5. Payment Gateway Integration**

- **Objective**: Enable secure payment handling for both guest checkouts and subscriptions.
- **Tasks**:
  - Choose and integrate a payment gateway that supports both one-time and recurring payments.
  - Ensure compliance with PCI-DSS standards.
  - Develop hooks for payment success, failure, and notifications for subscription renewals.
- **Deliverable**: Integrated Payment Gateway with Secure Transaction Handling

### **6. Analytics Dashboard Enhancement**

- **Objective**: Enhance the dashboard to include metrics for both guest checkouts and subscription models.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Dashboard Views**:
    - Build views for tracking guest checkouts vs. subscriptions.
    - Display metrics like average revenue per guest, subscription churn rate, and renewal rates.
  - **Real-time Analytics**:
    - Integrate real-time tracking for active users, guest checkout flow drop-offs, and subscription activations.
    - Add alerts for important metrics (e.g., spike in cancellations).
- **Deliverable**: Enhanced Analytics Dashboard with Guest Checkout & Subscription Metrics

### **7. Testing and Quality Assurance**

- **Objective**: Ensure functionality and security of guest checkout and subscription features.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Unit Testing**:
    - Test all new API endpoints, payment gateway integrations, and frontend components.
  - **Integration Testing**:
    - Test guest checkout flow from start to finish.
    - Ensure seamless interaction between the subscription model and the existing appointment scheduling.
